            <p>Development and Production</p>
            
            The development of League of Legends began in 2006, spearheaded by Brandon Beck and 
            Marc Merrill, who sought to create a game that combined the strategic depth of Defense 
            of the Ancients (DotA) with a more accessible and standalone platform. The production 
            spanned approximately three years, culminating in the game's official release on 
            October 27, 2009. While specific figures regarding the initial development budget are 
            not publicly disclosed, Riot Games' commitment to continuous improvement is evident in 
            their substantial investments over the years. In 2023, CEO Nicolo Laurent stated that 
            League of Legends had its "biggest budget ever," reflecting the company's dedication 
            to enhancing the game's quality and player experience.

            Other permanent modes include ARAM (All Random, All Mid), featuring a single-lane map 
            called Howling Abyss, and Teamfight Tactics, an auto-battler mode introduced in 2019 
            that has gained its own following.
