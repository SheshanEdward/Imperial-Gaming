            Worlds 2024 saw participation from 20 elite teams representing various regions. 
            These teams competed for the coveted Summoner's Cup and a share of the $2.25 million prize pool. 
            The tournament's format was divided into three primary stages: Play-In, Swiss Stage, and Knockout Stage.

            <p>Play-In Stage</p>
            The tournament kicked off with the Play-In Stage held at Riot Games Arena in Berlin from September 25 to 29. 
            This phase featured eight teams from smaller regions and fourth seeds from major regions. 
            The double-elimination bracket allowed four teams to advance to the Swiss Stage, ensuring a blend of 
            competition between underdogs and more established squads.

            <p>Swiss Stage</p>
            From October 3 to 13, the Swiss Stage saw 16 teams, including those advancing from Play-Ins and 
            directly qualified teams, battle it out. The Swiss-system format included five rounds, with each 
            match being a best-of-three. Teams needed three wins to progress to the Knockout Stage, while three 
            losses resulted in elimination. This stage, hosted again in Berlin, provided fans with intense matches 
            and upsets, setting the stage for the final phase.
